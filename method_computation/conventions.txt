CALL NAMES:
    Call names will always be stored as:
        miss / plain = "P"
        bob / - = "B"
        single = "S"
        All calls are capitalised, and any other calls e.g. Grandsire extremes are stored as a capital letter.
    Call names will always be displayed in grids / displays as:
        miss / plain = ""
        bob = "-"
        single = "S"

        All other calls will be displayed as they are stored

    Call names will always be displayed in text form as the way they are stored ("P", "B", "S")

    If no bobs or singles are given, the software will assume a default set of bobs and singles:
        Doubles: "B": "14", "S": "123"
        Minor and above: "B": "14", "S": "1234"
        These are the bobs and singles for plain bob

    When creating methods, make sure that none of the calls have the same notation as any of that method's calling
    positions; this will confuse the program, and lead to mistakes during touch computations
CALLING POSITIONS:
    Calling positions are always stored as these standards:
        Out / O = "B" (Before)
        Four / Make the bob / 4 = "4"

        All others will be stored as their capital equivelents.

    Calling positions are always indexed by the index of the calling bell AFTER THE CALL.

PLACE NOTATION:
    Place notation is stored with the following conventions:
        "-": "X"
